This is my first Vue project, using only CDN and some DOM interactions. This project is inspired by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Vue course.

It's a web page game where there's a monster you have to fight against. You can attack, use a special attack, heal, or surrender. After each attack you make, the monster counterattacks.

A battle log has been created to display messages during the battle. You don't need to run anything, just open the index.html file in your browser.
